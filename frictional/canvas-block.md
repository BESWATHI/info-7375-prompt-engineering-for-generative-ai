# Canvas paste blocks

Short blocks for the Canvas side. The Assignment rubrics already carry the Frictional row and link [prerequisites/frictional.md](../prerequisites/frictional.md); these add the teaching module without duplicating the rules.

## A. Module description (Canvas module "Frictional")

> Ten percent of every Assignment is the Frictional log — an honest, specific, dated record of how the work actually went, submitted as `FRICTIONAL.md` alongside your code. It is not a timesheet and not a performance of suffering. An unsuccessful attempt can earn full credit; a vague account of a successful one cannot.
>
> Read these before Assignment 1. Start with **Worked Examples** if you only read one.

---

## B. Appended to each Assignment description

> **Frictional — 10% of this Assignment.** Include `FRICTIONAL.md` in your submitted version. Short dated entries written while you work: what you tried and expected, what resisted and what you did next, what Claude or another person contributed and what you accepted, changed, or rejected, what you now understand or still do not, and the commit, test, or output that backs each entry.
>
> Rules: [prerequisites/frictional.md](../prerequisites/frictional.md). Guidance and scored examples: the Frictional module.

## C. Announcement, week one

> A note on the Frictional log, since it is 10% of every Assignment and it is not a component most courses have.
>
> Your code used to be proof that you had done the thinking. It isn't anymore — a working implementation can be produced by something that did none of the cognitive work the Assignment is designed to develop. I would rather ask you to document your process than run your submissions through a detector that doesn't work and treats all of you as suspects. So: use Claude Code, use it heavily if you want, and log what it did and what you did with it.
>
> It costs about twelve minutes per Assignment if you write it while you work, and considerably more if you reconstruct it at the end — and the reconstruction scores worse, because the specific confusions are exactly what you forget once you've solved them.
>
> Read the Frictional module before Assignment 1. The worked examples show a 2/10 log and a 10/10 log for the same work.

## D. Canvas rubric

`rubric/frictional-rubric.csv` imports the five criteria as a standalone 10-point Canvas rubric, for instances where Frictional is graded in its own column. Set range scoring off. If the Assignment is not worth 100, either rescale the rating values (on a 25-point Assignment each row is 0.5 / 0.25 / 0) or keep the 10-point rubric and weight the column at 10%.

If you instead grade all 100 points on one Assignment rubric, the row already exists in `assignments/fall-2026/assignment-XX.md` and the CSV is unnecessary.
