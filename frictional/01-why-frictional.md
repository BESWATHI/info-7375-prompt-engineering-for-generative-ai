# Why This Course Grades the Frictional Log

**What this page is.** The reasoning behind the Frictional share of every Assignment — 10% of the grade, whatever the Assignment is worth. The rules live in [prerequisites/frictional.md](../prerequisites/frictional.md); this is why they are the rules.

**Why it exists.** Your artifact — the Python module, the report, the tests — used to be proof that you had done the thinking. It is no longer sufficient proof. The Frictional log is the second evidence stream that carries what the artifact can no longer carry alone.

**What follows from that.** You are not graded on whether the work went well. You are graded on whether the record of it is honest, specific, and traceable.

## The causal chain that broke

Traditional assessment rests on an implicit model:

```
genuine learning → cognitive process → artifact
```

The artifact was never the thing we cared about. We cared about the process — schema formation, conceptual development, the capacity for transfer. The artifact was useful because it sat causally downstream of the process. Measuring one measured both.

Generative AI inserts a bypass:

```
AI generation → artifact
```

The artifact now has two causal pathways, and inspecting the artifact cannot tell you which one was taken. A working prompt contract with passing validation can be produced in minutes by a system that performed none of the cognitive work the assignment was designed to develop.

This is not temporary. It is a structural change driven by generation technology improving continuously, and the forensic window — the period during which artifact analysis can distinguish generated from developed work — closes sequentially across domains. In prose it is largely closed. In code it is closing.

## Why this course does not use a detector

Three structural problems, and all three are the kind of evaluation claim this course asks you to hold to a held-out set.

**Temporally bounded.** Every detector is trained on current generation outputs. Generation improves. A detector calibrated on today's outputs fails on tomorrow's. The arms race has a predictable winner.

**Wrong question.** The educationally relevant question is not *did a human type this*. It is *did a human develop this understanding*. Those are different questions and only the second one is worth your tuition. Detection answers the first, imperfectly.

**Perverse incentives.** A detector teaches students to defeat the detector. The strategies get shared and improve. The material is not what anyone ends up engaging with.

A rule enforceable only against the honest is not a rule. It is a tax on honesty. So this course asks you to document instead, and permits AI use openly — see [AI policy](../prerequisites/ai-policy.md).

## Performance is not learning

Robert and Elizabeth Bjork's distinction is the one that matters here. **Performance** is observable behavior during or immediately after instruction. **Learning** is the more durable change that supports later access and transfer to novel contexts. The two come apart routinely, and the conditions that maximize one often suppress the other.

The artifact measures performance. A student who generated a working implementation has performed well — the tests pass — and may have learned nothing. AI assistance is the limiting case: maximum performance, potentially zero learning process.

What the course needs to see is learning. Learning leaves traces that performance does not.

## Why friction, specifically

Genuine learning is a biological event, not a metaphor. When material genuinely challenges your current model, prediction-error signaling fires, consolidation machinery engages, and the mental model gets rebuilt. Without a violation of what you expected, the teaching signal does not fire and the model does not change.

That process has behavioral consequences: abandoned approaches, specific confusions, predictions that did not hold, the test you wrote because you did not believe the first result. Those are the friction traces. An AI can produce the artifact without any of those events occurring — and so it cannot produce their traces, because there were none.

This is also why smoothness is not the goal. A clean narrative from empty directory to passing tests is not evidence of skill; it is an absence of recorded information. Perceptual fluency feels like understanding and is not the same thing. In this course a rough, searching log is worth more than a polished one.

## What this is not

**Not a timesheet.** More hours, more commits, and more mistakes do not earn more points. A straightforward assignment honestly reported as straightforward, with the checks you ran named, earns full credit.

**Not a performance of suffering.** Inventing struggle is both more work than documenting real work and easier to spot, because invented confusions are generic. If section two took you twenty minutes, write that.

**Not surveillance.** Nothing logs your keystrokes or your browser. You decide what evidence to keep and what to hand in. The log is read to teach you, it stays with your instructor and TAs, and it does not become an institutional behavioral record.

**Not an AI trap.** AI use is allowed and expected in this course. Undisclosed use is the problem. Disclosure costs nothing and is worth 2 of the 10 rubric points on its own.

## What it costs

Five to fifteen minutes per Assignment, written across your work sessions rather than at the end. Reconstructing at the end is both more work and worse evidence: once you have solved something, the shape of your confusion is the first thing you forget, and that shape is most of what is being graded.
